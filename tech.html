        <h3>Peaking Interest</h3>
       <p>
        From a young age I had always been interested in tinkering with technology.
        It all really began with video games, and what a gaming console actually was.
        I grew up playing on a wide range of consoles fron the Gameboy to the Playstation.
        When upgrading to the next game console I would often find videos on YouTube of people opening and modding their consoles.
        This inspired me to open up my systems and see what was inside.       
        </p>
        <p>
        There are two projects specifically that really opened my eyes to how game companies customize hardware and software 
        to fill specific needs.
        </p>
        <p>
        One of the earliest attempts to see the inside of a console was with my Gamcube. 
        We had recently gotten a Wii in the household, and I saw it as my chance to take apart the gamecube. 
        It seemed like a good low risk way to see what was inside a game console. 
        I hit my first road block right off the bat when I realized that Nintendo used four special <em>4.5mm security scews</em> to hold the case in place.
        After obtaining the proper screwdriver I went to work. 
        While we owned a computer, and I was familiar with the components I had never opened a system before.
        The most facinating thing to me was how closely the Gamecube components were to a PC.
        I could tell these components were customized by Nintendo to be as compact as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
        My second project involved installing custom software onto my PSP.
        The software in question was a Gameboy Advanced emulator. 
        I thought it would be cool to have Nintendo games on my Playstation Portable system. 
        Getting the emulator on the system was not as simple as I thought.
        I was tasked with installing a custom OS onto my system.
        First I had to verify the model number of my system, and ensure it was on the latest firmware from Sony.
        After this I was able to remove the SD card on my system, and insert it into my laptop.
        This allowed me to put the custom firmawre onto the SD card, and resinsert it into the PSP for installation.
        The next steps were pretty similar to the first.
        I removed the SD card again used my laptop to install the GBA emulator.
        After that I was able to repeat the same process to get my game files onto the system.
        </p>
        <p>
        These two projects helped me to learn some of the basics of hardware and software. 
        It also taught me about the customizability of both aspects of the system. 
        I was impressed with the small form factor of the Gamecube.
        Nintendo was able to fit such a capable gaming machine (for the time) into something that resembled a lunchbox.
        Installing custom firmware onto my PSP was a fun project that I still have today. 
        It was cool to customize my system.
        It was cool to use data transfer in this way.
        I never realized you could store and transfer data in this way.  
        </p>

        <h3>Present Day Projects</h3>
        <p>
        As I got older I was called on to help set up various devices, along with troubleshoot basic issues.
        I would frequently be called to my grandparents house to fix connectivity issues with their printer.
        As well as set up televisions, and internet connections.
        </p>
        <p>
        I have become somewhat of a tech hobbiest at this point. 
        Not only am I called on to help family members with simple tasks, but my little cousins have started to become curious with technology as well.
        Through this similar interest I have helped them with various projects.
        Our biggest projects involving a Playstation 4, and modified Dell Optiplex PC.
        </p>
        <p>
        My cousin owns a PS4 slim model that was going through issues overheating.
        This felt like my first true project.
        My task was to find out why the PS4 was overheating, and see if we could fix it.
        After researching possible issues for this problem I decided it made the most sense to start with cleaning the system.
        This task required us to dissasmble the Playstation, and remove the dust.
        We used a combination of compressed air and brushes to clean the system.
        Once we put it back together the system was able to run without over heating.
        While it was a simple project it gave me some valuable experience with hardware.
        I had to research and familiarize myself with the PS4's structure before hand.
        </p>
        <p>
        The second project I wanted to highlight was a little more involved.
        It also required me to use some of the knowledge and skills I recently learned in my courses at Century College.
        Another family member of mine owns Dell Optiplex full tower PC that was modded for gaming.
        He used it for content creation as well. 
        He brought the system to me with a <em>Stop Error</em>, also known as the <em>Blue Screen of Death</em>
        After running through Windowws available troubleshooting tools I decided the best course of action was to reset the PC.
        I was lucky that he wanted to start fresh with his storage.
        This allowed me to start right away creating the USB drive to reset his system.
        I had just learned how to do this process in my <em>PC Haardware and Software</em> course.
        I used the <em>Windows Media Creation Tool</em>, to equip my SanDisk thumb drive with a Windows 10 install.
        After wipping the SSD clean I installed a copy of Windows 10 Home and activated it with his pre-existing Microsoft account.
        This allowed him to use and configure his system as if it were new. 
        </p>

        <h3>Future Endeavours</h3>
        <p>
        While I am still persuing my degree in Computer Techology Support and Administration, I have decided to learn more skills in my free time.
        As mentioned on my landing page this website is one of those endeavours.
        </p>
        <p>
        I want to learn various coding language, and hopefully apply my learnings to my life.
        I used HTML and CSS to build this website.
        I'm also interested in gaming and game dev.
        While I have used tools like RPG maker I wanted to get experience using code.
        I have experimented with Python as a starting point.
        Here are some of my beginner projects
        </p>
    <h2>CODING FUN</h2>
        <ul>
            PUT CODING PROJECTS HERE. WILL BE EDITED IN SOON
