        <h2>How It Began</h2>
        <p>
            I have been engrossed in music since a young age. 
            My parents started me playing the violin at the ripe age of three. 
            I spent my adolesent years playing with a youth group called <em>Minnesota Youth Symphonies</em> (MYS), as well as with my school orchestra. 
            During this time I had the privilage of playing yearly at Orchestra Hall. 
            We would occasionally be supported by a local artist, or composer at these concerts. 
            In my senior year with MYS, the Symphony Orchestra was even given the opportunity to play a tour in Cuba. 
            I look back fondly on my time playing in orchestra, and believe those experiences made me the person I am today.

        <h2>Trying New instruments</h2>
        <p>
            Once I reached my teen years I was interested in learning some other (more contemporary) instruments. 
            I began with the guitar when I was 9.

        <h2>Living The Dream</h2>
        <p>
            I am what you might call a creative.
            I also suffer from a condition called <em>Yes Man Syndrome</em>. 
            This is what led to some of the most memorable times in my life so far.
